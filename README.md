The purpose of this program was to test if we actually learn how to make instances, to test if we knew what methods were, and how to utilize them. It's just a simple program and doesn't have anything complicated.

Purpose:
Create two restaurant classes (McDonald's and BlazePizza) with unique attributes and methods, instantiate them, print their information, update some data, and print again to reflect changes.
